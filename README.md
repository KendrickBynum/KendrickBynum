<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Full-Stack Web App</b>
  - [WhatColor ColorBlind Assitence App](https://github.com/What-Color-SPU/What-Color)
  - Implemented AI to help users understand if colors are compatible or not
  - Created user accounts so users can create an account or sign into their account
- <b>Python-Based Web Crawler (Python)</b>
  - [Web Crawler](https://github.com/csc3430-winter2025/graph-a-computer-science-team)
  - Implemented a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to navigate through web pages up to a specified depth, ensuring comprehensive coverage without redundancy.
  - Utilized networkx library to build a directed graph where nodes represent unique URLs and edges denote hyperlinks between pages.
  - Incorporated mechanisms to identify and handle cycles within the web graph, preventing infinite loops during traversal
  - Stores the resulting graph data in a structured format (e.g., adjacency list or matrix) for further analysis or visualization.
  - Included robust exception handling ot manage HTTP errors, timeouts, and invalid URLs gracefully.
- <b>Rust Systems Programming</b>
  - [Naruto Battle Arena](https://github.com/csc3310-fall2024/rust-KendrickBynum)
  - Built systems-level applications in Rust, emphasizing memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
  - Implemented command-line tools with efficient memory management.
  - Leveraged Rust's ownership model to prevent data races.
  - Explored concurrency primitives for parallel processing tasks.
- <b>Weighted Interval Scheduling</b>
  - [Weighted Interval Scheduling](https://github.com/csc3310-fall2024/rust-KendrickBynum)
  - Implemented the weighted interval scheduling algorithm using dynamic programming to optimize job scheduling based on weights
  - Developed a bottom-up dynamic programming solution.
  - Parsed input data to identify non-overlapping intervals with maximum total weight.
  - Visualized scheduling decisions to demonstrate algorithm efficiency.
- <b>C++ Programming</b>
  - [Simple Encryptions](https://github.com/KendrickBynum/SimpleEncryptions)
  - Created C++ programs to perform basic encryption and decryption, illustrating fundamental cryptographic techniques.
  - Implemented XOR-based encryption for text data.
  - Developed a Caesar cipher variant for file encryption.
  - Demonstrated the principles of symmetric key encryption.
