<h2>üõ°Ô∏è Security Engineering Projects:</h2>

- <b>SolarWinds Supply Chain Breach Analysis (Threat Modeling, IR Mapping, MITRE ATT&CK)</b>  
  - [SolarWinds Breach Analysis](https://github.com/KendrickBynum/SolarWinds-Supply-Chain-Breach-Analysis)  
  - Studied the 2020 SolarWinds attack and outlined how I would prevent and detect similar breaches.  
  - Mapped the incident to NIST's IR Framework and documented adversary TTPs.  
  - Proposed architecture changes and detection strategies based on industry best practices.
 
- <b>NGINX DoS Attack Mitigation Project (Python, Wireshark, NGINX)</b>
  - [DoS Mitigation with NGINX and Wireshark](https://github.com/KendrickBynum/DoS-Mitigation-with-NGINX-Traffic-Analysis-via-Wireshark)
  - Simulated a Slowloris DoS attack using Python to overwhelm an NGINX web server.
  - Captured network traffic with Wireshark to observe before, during, and after attack phases.
  - Hardened server configuration using NGINX rate limiting to mitigate the attack.
  - Demonstrated proactive security engineering with real-world network defense techniques.

<h2>üß™ SOC Analyst Projects:</h2>

- <b>Malware Upload Detection & Response (Splunk + Catalyst)</b>  
  - [Malware Upload Investigation](https://github.com/KendrickBynum/Malware-Upload-Detection-Response-Splunk-Catalyst-)  
  - Simulated the detection and response of a suspicious `.exe` upload using Splunk.  
  - Investigated the incident using Catalyst and mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK.  
  - Documented all artifacts, queries, and remediation actions.

- <b>Splunk Capture the Flag Investigation (SIEM, Log Analysis, Threat Detection)</b>  
  - [Splunk CTF Project](https://github.com/KendrickBynum/Splunk-CTF-Project)  
  - Completed a structured CTF focused on identifying threats through Splunk dashboards and log queries.  
  - Applied detection logic to find suspicious commands, persistence techniques, and malicious artifacts.  
  - Demonstrated analytical workflow for a SOC analyst in a live incident simulation.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Full-Stack Web App (JavaScript, React, AWS)</b>
  - [WhatColor ColorBlind Assistance App](https://github.com/What-Color-SPU/What-Color)
  - Implemented AI to help users understand if colors are compatible or not
  - Created user accounts so users can create an account or sign into their account
- <b>Python-Based Web Crawler (Python, networkx, requests and BeautifulSoup for HTTP requests and HTML parsing)</b>
  - [Web Crawler](https://github.com/csc3430-winter2025/graph-a-computer-science-team)
  - Implemented a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to navigate through web pages up to a specified depth, ensuring comprehensive coverage without redundancy.
  - Utilized networkx library to build a directed graph where nodes represent unique URLs and edges denote hyperlinks between pages.
  - Incorporated mechanisms to identify and handle cycles within the web graph, preventing infinite loops during traversal
  - Stores the resulting graph data in a structured format (e.g., adjacency list or matrix) for further analysis or visualization.
  - Included robust exception handling ot manage HTTP errors, timeouts, and invalid URLs gracefully.
- <b>Rust Systems Programming(Rust, Cargo, Systems Programming Concepts)</b>
  - [Naruto Battle Arena](https://github.com/csc3310-fall2024/rust-KendrickBynum)
  - Built systems-level applications in Rust, emphasizing memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
  - Implemented command-line tools with efficient memory management.
  - Leveraged Rust's ownership model to prevent data races.
  - Explored concurrency primitives for parallel processing tasks.
- <b>Weighted Interval Scheduling(Python, Dynamic Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms)</b>
  - [Weighted Interval Scheduling](https://github.com/csc3310-fall2024/rust-KendrickBynum)
  - Implemented the weighted interval scheduling algorithm using dynamic programming to optimize job scheduling based on weights
  - Developed a bottom-up dynamic programming solution.
  - Parsed input data to identify non-overlapping intervals with maximum total weight.
  - Visualized scheduling decisions to demonstrate algorithm efficiency.
- <b>C++ Programming(C++, Standard Template Library, Cryptographic Concepts)</b>
  - [Simple Encryptions](https://github.com/KendrickBynum/SimpleEncryptions)
  - Created C++ programs to perform basic encryption and decryption, illustrating fundamental cryptographic techniques.
  - Implemented XOR-based encryption for text data.
  - Developed a Caesar cipher variant for file encryption.
  - Demonstrated the principles of symmetric key encryption.
